# SVG-Logo-Maker

Project Description: The goal of this project was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

    * When a user uses the generator, they are presented with a command-line application that accepts user input.
    * When the user initiates the app, they are prompted for text for their logo. If their text is more than 3 characters, the app makes, them restart, to add the correct amount of allowable text.
    * When the user inputs their data, an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`. When the user open the `logo.svg` file in a browser, they are shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria entered.
